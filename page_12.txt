In November, you and Kartik became good friends, spending a lot of time together. Even though I'm not sure about all the details, it was clear that something special was happening between you two. seeing you and Kartik getting close brought a twinge of mixed feelings. It's not easy to put into words, but there was a subtle emotion there. Yet, looking back, it's all part of the journey

On my side, November was mostly about exams. But what really got me excited was planning our upcoming trip to Manali. We spent a lot of time getting ready for the adventure, making the month more about our trip plans than anything else.

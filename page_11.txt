October marked a new beginning as I purchased my first iPhone (thanks to Papa's generosity). On the very first day, you took some photos, but the next day, to my surprise, all the photos disappeared from my phone. The mystery of how that happened remains unsolved! 🤷

This month presented us with the opportunity to participate in a presentation competition. Initially a solo endeavor, Samien's last-minute revelation turned it into a group competition. Unfortunately, I forgot to inform you about this twist until the last moment. When you found out, you didn't believe that I genuinely didn't know about the group aspect. To this day, you playfully taunt me about it😭. However, despite always prioritizing our group over winning now one saw the struggle of mine, but from the next hackathon, i have decided to go together (me, you, Kartik, Umesh), fuck Samien. It's time for a change!🫡

You used to send me your songs on Snapchat. Little did you know, I secretly captured those moments in videos. 😂 Let's attach some of those musical memories to this journey.

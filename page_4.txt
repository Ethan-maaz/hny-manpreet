𝗠𝗮𝗿𝗰𝗵: 𝗨𝗻𝗶𝘁𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗧𝗿𝗶𝗯𝗲

This month brought about a significant change. Our group got divided into two sections, and you and Kartik fought for our unity, representing us in the faculty discussions. (waise to main bhi tha but mujhe koi nhi gintaa🙃)

The division, although temporary, became a big deal for all of us. Change wasn't easy, and being split from the gang felt like a puzzle with missing pieces. But hey, no worries! It didn't take long for the universe to fix things, and soon we found ourselves back in the same section. The joy of our whole group being together again was ❤️.

Then, when our whole group was back together, we kicked off a new kind of fun. We started playing around with each other's photos. You edited my pictures with Pathan and fanta. And i edited your pics with Moutawakel and jerimiah to yours. It was all in good fun, and the laughs we shared while teasing each other became a special part of our growing friendship.

But that wasn't all. In February 2023, our whole group decided to catch the Pathan movie together. It turned out to be a blast, filled with laughter, snacks, and shared commentary on the movie.

Something magical happened during that movie outing. Our entire group clicked, and suddenly, spending time together became a regular thing. We started playing basketball, volleyball, and badminton together. Those games brought us even closer, creating a bond beyond just casual friends.

Talking about basketball, I distinctly remember that one day. While we were in the middle of a game, a boy decided to approach you with some rather annoying intentions. He wanted to propose! I could see how irritating it was for you, and you handled it so gracefully. You asked him to leave, but he insisted on talking for just 2 minutes. Back then, we weren't that close, and I wish I could have done something. But hey, if someone like him ever comes back to irritate you, just let me know. I'm ready to close that chapter for good.

As February unfolded with movie outings, sports, and the occasional drama, we had no idea that even more adventures, camaraderie, and shared laughter awaited us in the coming months.

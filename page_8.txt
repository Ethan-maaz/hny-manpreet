July kicked off with the last day of exams, and on that very day, I invited you to watch "Insidious: The Red Door" with the whole group. Unfortunately, you couldn't make it as you were heading to Jaipur. Sometimes, life's plans take us on unexpected journeys.

As the month unfolded, our end semester results were revealed, and you achieved an impressive 3rd rank in the class. I couldn't help but feel incredibly proud, securing the 4th rank right after you.

July also marked a special day – your birthday on the 30th. Determined to give you a meaningful present, I faced the challenge of deciding what to gift. Unsure if a traditional gift would be accepted, I opted for a digital surprise. It took the entire month to create, and when I finally presented it to you, your positive reaction was priceless. You mentioned that no one had ever made something like that for you, making the effort all the more satisfying.

July brought surprises, achievements, and a unique birthday celebration. Little did we know that more shared moments, surprises, and milestones awaited us in the coming months.

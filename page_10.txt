𝗦𝗲𝗽𝘁𝗲𝗺𝗯𝗲𝗿: 𝗔 𝗠𝗶𝘅 𝗼𝗳 𝗘𝗺𝗼𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻𝘀 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗦𝘂𝗿𝗽𝗿𝗶𝘀𝗲𝘀

September brought a mix of feelings, especially as you were recovering from dengue at the beginning of the month. Your absence from college made me skip a few days too. It got to the point where our entire group decided to visit my home to pick me up for college one day – a quirky and memorable event!

Honestly, not seeing you around the college made me a bit sad (I don't know why, maybe I got used to our routine 😅). However, as the days passed, things improved. You started teasing and flirting, keeping the atmosphere light and fun.

One day, I discovered your fingerprint on my phone, a playful move I only found out about a few days later. Who knows what mischief you managed to explore on my phone during that time?😂

I also recall those moments when you used to send me makeup tutorials on Snapchat. The fun part? I saved them all! 😂 One day, while you were in the midst of making snaps, your father was watching you from the window and was wondering that what she is doing. What a hilarious moment! 😂

September brought a mix of emotions, surprises, and a touch of playful mischief.

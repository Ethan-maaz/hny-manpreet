i still remember you send a reel from the Wednesday web series. What's even cooler is that it turned out to be the first thing we found in common. We weren't super close yet, just classmates figuring things out. But that video became our inside joke, our shared laughter that started our friendship journey.

At that time, we were still getting to know each other, not yet the close friends we would become. Little did we know, that seemingly casual act of sharing a reel would mark the beginning of a connection that would grow into a beautiful friendship.

But the surprises didn't end there! One day in January, we found out we were on the same metro, just one car apart. Thanks to Snapchat, we realized this happy coincidence. Spontaneously, we decided to meet at the Jamia Millia Islamia metro station.

Laughing at that reel, accidentally meeting on the metro, and sharing moments at Jamia Millia Islamia station – little did we know that more adventures and laughter were waiting for us in the rest of the year.

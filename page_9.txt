In August, your mother asked me to come to college to help explain some scholarship confusion. Admittedly, I was a bit nervous about meeting her, but, as it turned out, she was very cool about it. It was a moment of shared understanding and support.

Later in the month, you invited Kartik and me to your birthday party. Unfortunately, Kartik couldn't make it, so Sandhya joined us. The Logix Mall outing became a day filled with laughter and fun, creating lasting memories.

August had its tough moments for you, and we won't delve into those. Instead, let's focus on a simple sentiment: Even in tough times, there's a small spark of love that goes beyond life and death. It's in the things she taught, the memories she left, and the strength we find in the pieces of her spirit that stay with us. Even when things get tough, remember to stay strong. There's a light of resilience within you that can guide through the darkest times. 𝗔𝗹𝘄𝗮𝘆𝘀 𝘀𝘁𝗮𝘆 𝘀𝘁𝗿𝗼𝗻𝗴 𝗠𝗮𝗻𝗽𝗿𝗲𝗲𝘁.

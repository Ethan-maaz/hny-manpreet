In May, something big happened. We secured the 2nd place in the GNIOT hackathon, and it felt awesome. Your speech was so good that even some teammates got a little jealous (oops! 😂).

Another chance came our way in May for a hackathon at Bhartiya Vidyapeeth college. However, when it was time to form a team, Samien had different ideas. He didn't want you in the team, but I didn't want to go without you. But you decided to go without me, and it was a little sad for me. But that's okay because it's your life, and when you got the opportunity, you grabbed it. It's a good thing.

Now, here's a funny part. Nakul decided to share one of my songs, "Tere Hawale," in the final group. It might have been a bit embarrassing for me, but everyone took it positively. After that, the roles reversed, and I started sending you songs (hope you don't mind! 😂).

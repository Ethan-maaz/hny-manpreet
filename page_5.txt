𝗔𝗽𝗿𝗶𝗹: 𝗙𝗮𝗰𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗖𝗵𝗮𝗹𝗹𝗲𝗻𝗴𝗲𝘀 𝗧𝗼𝗴𝗲𝘁𝗵𝗲𝗿

In April, our group planned to watch Pope's Exorcist, but I had to leave during the most exciting part for Friday Namaz.

Around the same time, things got tough. Your friendship with Umesh hit a rough patch, and those days were not easy. I was away at home, and it was a difficult period.

I remember you saying, "Shayad ane wale time mein tu mere se baat na kare, itni buri halat hone wali hain. Dhayn rakho apna." Those words made me decide to always try and keep our friendship strong, no matter what.

Despite the challenges, we managed to get through. We even signed up for the GNIOT hackathon. I had to ask Samien to include you in the team, and eventually, we found ourselves working together.

April showed us that even when times are tough, friendships can endure. Little did we know that more shared adventures, laughter, and strength awaited us in the months to come.

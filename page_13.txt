December brought the stress of computational methods for end-semester exams. Finally, after the exams concluded, we embarked on our much-anticipated trip to Manali. The place, the views—absolutely breathtaking. The cold was intense, but the fun we had made it all worthwhile.

Yet, every journey has its challenges. On the first day of the trip, you were overcome with emotion, tears streaming down your face. You uttered, "Mujhe maaz Chahiye! mujhe maaz chahiye!." In that moment, I realized the place I held in your life. The only regret? Not being able to sit with you on the bus during the journey. 😂 Already missing those times we spent together during the trip. Can't we turn back time? Let's go on another trip with the group.

You loved watching the mountains, and I? I loved watching you.

December brought exams, the enchantment of Manali, and moments etched in our hearts. While we can't reverse time, the memories we created will forever be cherished. As we bid farewell to this year, who knows what adventures and shared moments await us in the coming year.

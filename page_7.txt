June rolled in with the pressure of end-semester exams, particularly in subjects like DBMS and Operating System. It was one of those months filled with studying and academic challenges.

Despite the academic stress, our regular routine continued. We found solace and a bit of fun playing badminton and basketball. The familiar rhythm of these activities became a comforting backdrop to the exam grind.

Our group decided to go to Adventure Island for some thrills. Unfortunately, you couldn't join us as the only girl, and that was absolutely okay. It's important to prioritize comfort, and we understood that you might not have felt at ease going alone.

June might have been a bit routine, but little did we know that more varied experiences, shared moments, and unexpected turns awaited us in the months ahead.
